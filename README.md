Thrilled to share my recent Power BI project on Car Price Prediction: An Exploratory Data Analysis! ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

Leveraged historical car sales data to identify key price influencing factors and trends. This project involved extensive data cleaning, applying powerful DAX functions to create KPIs like Total Sales ($131.60M from 2,500 cars sold, averaging $52.64K per car across 7 unique brands), and developing an interactive dashboard for actionable insights. 

Key insights gained include:
>Strong market preference for automatic transmission vehicles. 
>Significant price volatility influenced by external factors. 
>Brand-specific performance differences, like Tesla as a premium, low- mileage option. 

This project honed my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and deriving strategic recommendations for inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies.
